		<h1>Young</h1>
		<h2>Vallis Alps</h2>
		<img src="img/vallisalps.jpg">
		<p>Look back<br />
		To when midnights broke their sleep<br />
		Awake in our memories<br />
		Of when we would make believe<br />
		Collide<br />
		Colors of the masquerade<br />
		Watch as they fall away<br />
		Faceless under faces made</p>
		<br />
		<p>And weeks went by but felt like hours<br />
		Spring would lie in summer showers<br />
		In my hair were winter flowers<br />
		And weeks went by but felt like hours<br />
		Seasons multiplying powers<br />
		That I found in winter flowers</p>
		<br />
		<p>Turn back<br />
		I see rivers beyond the line<br />
		Ancient roads in broken design<br />
		Angels running thru our minds<br />
		Look up<br />
		Your city's built on marble floors<br />
		Neon lights in the falling snow<br />
		Those nights back in Tokyo</p>
		<br />
		<p>And weeks went by but felt like hours<br />
		Spring would lie in summer showers<br />
		In my hair were winter flowers<br />
		And weeks went by but felt like hours<br />
		Seasons multiplying powers<br />
		That I found in winter flowers
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>And we said<br />
		This has only just begun<br />
		In the end<br />
		Time forever favors the young</p>
		<br />
		<p>And we said<br />
		This has only just begun<br />
		In the end<br />
		Time forever favors the young</p>
